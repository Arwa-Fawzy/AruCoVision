# AruCoVision
ArUco marker for pose estimation, camera calibration, and augmented reality to track object movement.

### What is ArUco Markers?
ArUco markers are square or rectangular patterns of black and white squares used in computer vision for object tracking and pose estimation.

### What is Open Source package can be used for this marker?
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library 
### How many ArUco Markers pattern provided in OpenCV?
The aruco module in OpenCV has a total of 25 predefined dictionaries of markers. 
All the markers in a dictionary contain the same number of blocks or bits(4×4, 5×5, 6×6 or 7×7), and each dictionary contains a fixed number of markers(50, 100, 250 or 1000).

### Marker patterns available on the market

### What are the requirments for the markers?

1. **Distinct Pattern**: ArUco markers must have a unique black and white pattern.
2. **Contrast**: The pattern should have clear contrast for reliable detection.
3. **Size**: Marker size should suit the application and distance from the camera.
4. **Resolution**: The pattern resolution should enable accurate detection.
5. **Orientation**: Markers should be detectable from any orientation.
